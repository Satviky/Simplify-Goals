# 🛤️ Roadmap – Simplify Goals

A soft journey. Not a sprint. This roadmap is flexible and built with self-kindness in mind.
Also, this is like my favourite project out of all..., so i don't want to rush into this, but build it with gentle care and love.

##  Phase 1 – Groundwork
- Set up Expo + React Native project structure
- Create calming Home Screen layout
- Implement offline-first habit tracking (AsyncStorage)
- Design amoeba-shaped floating action button
- Basic goal creation: name, color, emoji

##  Phase 2 – Gentle Features
- Add streak tracking per goal
- Soft progress animations (confetti, glow, ripple)
- Minimal stats (e.g., "4-day streak", "last check-in: yesterday")
- Begin calm mode: silent breathing view or quote card

##  Phase 3 – Emotional Intelligence
- Add mood-tag check-ins (optional)
- Build visual calendar for habit emotions
- Introduce reflective journaling snippets

##  Phase 4 – Polishing & Personalization
- UI polish: color themes, font options
- Sound/haptic feedback (opt-in)
- Export backup (cloud or file)
- Release to close circle for feedback

> This app is a safe space. Even the roadmap follows gentle curves, not deadlines.
